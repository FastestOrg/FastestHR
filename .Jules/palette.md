**Learning:** Discovered that the ResetPassword component lacked a 'show/hide' visibility toggle for the new password and confirm password fields, leading to increased user friction and potential blind typing errors during account recovery.
**Action:** Adding state-managed visibility toggles to both password fields to match the behavior of the Login and Register forms, ensuring a consistent and accessible password entry experience.
