## 2025-03-24 - Accessibility improvements for icon buttons
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of icon-only `<button>` elements that lacked `aria-label` attributes for screen readers. Notably in Settings.tsx, HolidayCalendar.tsx, EmployeeDetail.tsx, and Performance.tsx.
**Action:** Adding `aria-label` attributes to improve screen reader accessibility.

## 2025-03-27 - Accessibility improvements for icon buttons
**Learning:** Found multiple instances of icon-only `<Button>` elements that lacked `aria-label` attributes for screen readers across `Topbar.tsx`, `NotificationsDropdown.tsx`, `AppSidebar.tsx`, `ApplyLeave.tsx`, `Documents.tsx`, `HelpDesk.tsx`, `Payroll.tsx`, `Settings.tsx`, `Employees.tsx`, and `Performance.tsx`.
**Action:** Adding `aria-label` attributes to improve screen reader accessibility.
## 2026-04-18 - AI Assistant Accessibility and Auto-focus
**Learning:** Found that the AI Assistant chat interface lacked basic accessibility (missing `aria-label` on icon-only Open, Close, and Send buttons) and forced the user to manually click into the input field after opening the chat overlay.
**Action:** Adding `aria-label`s for screen reader support and the `autoFocus` prop to the main chat input so it's ready for typing immediately when the overlay opens.
## 2025-05-18 - Password Visibility Toggles
**Learning:** Found that the "Confirm Password" field in `Register.tsx` and both password fields in `ResetPassword.tsx` lacked a visibility toggle, potentially leading to blind typing errors and user frustration during critical authentication flows.
**Action:** Implemented a standard UI pattern by wrapping the `Input` in a relative container and adding an absolute-positioned `Eye`/`EyeOff` icon `<Button>` toggle, ensuring each toggle manages its own localized state and includes appropriate `aria-label`s for screen readers.
